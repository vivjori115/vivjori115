## üî≠ Current Projects

### Tomato Disease Prediction

I developed a Plant Disease Prediction application using TensorFlow and Streamlit to assist farmers in identifying diseases in tomato plants. This project aligns with my educational background in Agriculture, where I gained a solid understanding of agricultural practices and challenges.

#### Key Features:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed an intuitive Streamlit app that allows users to upload images of plant leaves for analysis.
- **Image Processing**: Implemented image preprocessing techniques to prepare images for prediction.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Leveraged a TensorFlow model to provide real-time predictions with confidence scores, aiding farmers in making informed decisions.
